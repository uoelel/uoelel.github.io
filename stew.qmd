The Linguistics and English Language **Statistical Training Workshops** (**STeW**) is a series of workshops that runs throughout the academic year and is aimed at students and staff who would like to advance their statistical knowledge and skills.

On this page you can find information on the current plan for the a.y.
2023-24.
Attending requires you register and registration links are sent out via email at the beginning of each semester.
Further workshops might be added later during the year.

Most workshops are recorded and can be watched on the [LEL Quantitative Methods channel](https://media.ed.ac.uk/channel/LEL%2BQuantitative%2BMethods/308657412) on the UoE Media Hopper Create.

If you have any question, you can get in touch with Dr Stefano Coretta.

| **Description**   | GAMMs are useful to analyse historical data, time-series data or data that could have non-linear effects (like language development data). |
| **Prerequisites** | It assumes some familiarity with linear models fitted with `lmer()`/`glmer()` or `brm()`.                                                  |
