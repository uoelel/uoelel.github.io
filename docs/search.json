Most academic research uses R for data analysis, although Python is also employed especially for data processing.\nIf you want to teach yourself R, the following resources are an excellent place to start from:\n\nThe R for Data Science (R4DS) free online book is an excellent introduction to R and quantitative data analysis.\nThe Data Visualisation Catalogue is a project developed by Severino Ribecca to create a (non-code-based) library of different information visualisation types. The website serves as a learning and inspirational resource for those working with data visualisation.\nThe workshop intRo: Data Analysis with R introduces absolute beginners from the Humanities to R, quantitative data analysis and visualisation. Check out the videos on YouTube: videos. You can find the materials and slides here: materials and slides.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteJoining and pivoting data\n\n\n\n\n\nMost data wrangling problems can be solved with the following sets of R tidyverse functions (of course if you use Python or other languages, feel free to use their equivalents): mutating joins and pivoting.\n\nMutating joins allow you to join two or more tibbles together so that you can include information from one tibble into another (for example, if you have participant info in one tibble and you want to join that with the main experiment results tibble). See here for a visual representation of join operations.\nPivoting makes it easy to transform a data table that has all the information you need but not in the right format (for example you have a two columns with the participant’s scores at time point 1 and 2, but you want one column that has the time point and one that has the score).

We imbue them with meaning.\n—Nate Silver, The Signal and the Noise\n\nStatistics and statistical modelling are about finding meaning in the patterns that can be observed in the data.\n\nStatistics for Linguists: An introduction using R by Bodo Winter (Winter 2020) is ideal both for absolute beginners and experienced researchers. It is packed with everything you need to successfully and effectively conduct statistical analyses.\nStatistical (Re)thinking by Richard McElreath (McElreath 2020) is an excellent introduction for absolute beginners, by Richard McElreath, which covers a wide variety of linear models. It focusses on Bayesian inference and how this framework can help us directly answer research questions, assess evidence for different hypothesis, and quantify uncertainty. If you are familiar with the tidyverse, the code from the Statistical (Re)thinking book has been translated into tidyverse by Solomon Kurz, and it can be accessed here: Statistical rethinking with brms, ggplot2, and the tidyverse.\nThe Art of Statistics: Learning from data by David Spiegelhalter (Spiegelhalter 2020) uses real-world examples to explain principles of data visualisation and analysis. It touches upon a wide range of topics and disciplines, from communicating proportions, to probability and Bayesian inference, making it a great complement to the other books and resources mentioned here. If you just wish to dip your toes in statistics without committing (yet) to learning how to do statistics, this book is for you.\nLinear models and linear mixed effects models in R with linguistic applications by Bodo Winter is a short and intense tutorial on linear models (Winter 2013). The first part introduces you to Gaussian linear models and the second part to Gaussian linear models that include random effects (variably called mixed, hierarchical, nested models). Note that Gaussian linear models are not appropriate for the data of most linguistic research and you will have to learn and use other types of linear models.\n\n\n2.2.1 Regression models\n\nOne model to rule them all, one model to fit them, One model to shrink them all, and in probability bind them; In the Land of Inference where the distributions lie.\n—The Statistical Hobbit.\n\nRegression models are a very flexible and relatively straightforward way to model and analyse quantitative data. They have gained momentum and are increasingly being adopted across the entire field of linguistics.\nThe main perk of learning regression models is that they can be applied to many different types of data, so that once you learn this approach you will be able to apply it to a lot of data analysis scenarios.\nThe resources mentioned above all focus on regression modelling, so whether you are just starting your statistical journey or you are an experienced researcher who wants to consolidate their understanding of regression modelling, those resources are right for you.\nAfter you have learnt the basics, the Regression models cheat-sheet can guide you through the process of choosing among the appropriate types of models depending on the nature of your data. The post also lists tutorials on regression models that use other less common probability distribution families, like the beta, Poisson and ordinal.\nConfused about all the model names? Check out this post on how we don’t really need to use all of those names: they are all regression models!"

Causal inference allows researchers to select variables needed to estimate particular causal effects. One approach to causal inference is based on do-calculus and Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). Causal inference is explained in McElreath (2020), especially chapters 5 and 6. For a brief conceptual introduction, see McElreath (2021)."

Likert scales are common especially in sociolinguistics work, for example in work that investigates attitudes: e.g. a 5-point scale “disagree, somewhat disagree, neutral, somewhat agree, agree”.\nLikert-scale data special because they are categorical and ordered.\nOrdered data must be modelled using the appropriate distribution, namely the cumulative distribution. Ordinal linear models are an extension of linear models that use the cumulative distribution to model ordinal data, like Likert-scale data.\nFor an excellent tutorial on how to fit ordinal linear models using brms applied to linguistics data, see Verissimo (2021).

This method combines all of your variables into a limited set of numeric principal components. The scores of the principal components capture variation in the data and can be used for further analysis. You can learn how to carry out a PCA with this tutorial. Also check out Functional Principal Component Analysis below.\nMultiple Correspondence Analysis (McA) is the discrete equivalent of PCA, i.e. it can be used with discrete/categorical variables.

A power analysis is a method to estimate the minimum sample size necessary to detect a particular effect. The statistical power of a test is the percentage of tests that correctly detect an effect when the effect indeed exists. The recommended statistical power is 80% or greater.\nPower analyses with linear models can become quite complex, especially if random effects are included. Simulation is a way to simplify the calculations necessary to find the minimum sample size. The R package simr provides users with a set of functions to perform a power analysis with linear models using simulations.

    "text": "3 Step 1: Choose a distribution for your outcome variable\nThe first step towards building a regression model is to choose the family of distributions you believe the outcome variable belongs to. You can start by answering the following question.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipQuestion 1\n\n\n\nIs the outcome variable continuous or discrete?\n\n\nDepending on the answer, check out Section 3.1 or Section 3.2.\n\n3.1 Continuous outcome variable\n\nThe variable can take on any positive and negative real number, including 0: Gaussian (aka normal) distribution.\n\nThere are very few truly Gaussian variables, although in some cases one can speak of “approximate” or “assumed” normality.\nThis family is fitted by default in lm(), lme4::lmer() and brms::brm(). You can explicitly select the family with family = gaussian.\n\nThe variable can take on any positive real number only: Log-normal distribution.\n\nDuration of segments, words, pauses, etc, are known to be log-normally distributed.\nReaction times can be modelled with a log-normal distribution.\nMeasurements taken in Hz (like f0, formants, centre of gravity, …) could be considered to be log-normal.\nThere other families that could potentially be used depending on the nature of the variable: exponential-Gaussian (reaction times), gamma, …\nFit a log-normal model with brms::brm(..., family = lognormal).\n\nThe variable can take on any real number between 0 and 1, but not 0 nor 1: Beta distribution.\n\nProportions fall into this category (for example proportion of voicing within closure), although 0 and 1 are not allowed in the beta distribution.\nFit a beta model with brms::brm(..., family = Beta).\nCheck this tutorial: Coretta and Bürkner (n.d.).\n\nThe variable can take on any real number between 0 and 1, including 0 or 0 and 1: Zero-inflated or Zero/one-inflated beta (ZOIB) distribution.\n\nIf the proportion data includes many 0s and 1s, then this is the ideal distribution to use. ZOIB distributions are somewhat more difficult to fit than a simple beta distribution, so a common practice is to transform the data so that it doesn’t include 0s nor 1s (this can be achieved using different techniques, some better than others).\nFit a ZOIB model with brms::brm(..., family = zero_one_inflated_beta.\nCheck this tutorial: Heiss (2021).\n\n\n\n\n3.2 Discrete outcome variable\n\nThe variable is dichotomous, i.e. it can take one of two levels: Bernoulli distribution.\n\nCategorical outcome variables like yes/no, correct/incorrect, voiced/voiceless, follow this distribution.\nThis family is fitted by default when you run glm(..., family = binomial), aka “logistic regression” or “binomial regression” or with brms::brm(..., family = bernoulli).2\n\nThe variable is counts: Poisson distribution.\n\nCounts of words, segments, gestures, f0 peaks, …\nCheck out this tutorial: Winter and Bürkner (2021).\nFit a Poisson model with brms::brm(..., family = poisson).\nSometimes a negative binomial distribution is preferable, if the count data is dispersed. Fit this model with brms::brm(..., family = negbinomial).\n\nThe variable is a scale: ordinal linear model.\n\nLikert scales and ratings, language attitude questionnaires.\nFit ordinal regression models (aka ordinal logistic regression) with brms::brm(..., family = cumulative).\nSee these tutorials: Verissimo (2021), Bürkner and Vuorre (2019).\n\nThe variable has more than two levels, but it is not ordered: categorical (multinomial) model.\n\nFit categorical (multinomial) models with brms::brm(..., family = categorical).\nAs far as I know, there isn’t a tutorial for this family, but Lorson, Cummins, and Rohde (2021) uses categorical models. The research compendium (with data and code) of the paper can be found here: https://osf.io/e5av9/.\nJust a quick note: if you have an outcome variable with 3 levels (A, B and C) and you fit a categorical (multinomial) model, then \\(P(A) = \\frac{e^0}{e^0 + e^{B} + e^{C}}\\), where the superscripts \\(B\\) and \\(C\\) are the estimated log-odds difference of the B and C level vs the A level (these are the two intercepts in the model). This makes sense, because, assuming each level is equally probable, \\(\\frac{e^{0}}{1 + e^{0} + e^{0}} = 0.333\\) for all levels."

    "text": "4 Step 2: Are there hierarchical groupings and/or repeated measures?\nThe second step is to ensure that, if the data is structured hierarchically or repeated measures were taken, this is taken into account in the model. Here is where so-called varying terms (aka random effects, group-level effects/terms) come in (Gelman 2005). Models that include random effects/group-level terms are called: random-effects models, mixed-effects models, hierarchical models, nested models, multilevel models. These terms are for all intents and purposes equivalent (it just happens that different traditions use different terms).\nAs an example, let’s assume you asked a number of participants to read a list of words and each word was repeated 5 times by each participant. You then took f0 measurements from the stressed vowel of each word, of each repetition. Now, the data has a “hierarchical” structure to it:\n\nFirst, observations are grouped by participant (some observations belong to one participant and others to another and so on).\nSecond, observations are grouped by word (some observations belong to one word and others to another and so on).\nThird, within the observations of each word, some belong to the same participant (or, from a different perspective, within the observations of each participant, some belong to the same word).\n\nThe presence of “levels” within the data (whether they come from natural groupings like participant or word, or from repeated measures) breaks one of the assumptions of regression models: that each observation must be independent. This is why you must include varying terms in the regression model, to account for this structure (and now you see why they are called hierarchical and multilevel models). If you don’t include any varying term, your model will expect that each observation is independent and hence it will underestimate variance and return unreliable results.\nIn the toy-example of f0 measurements, you will want to include varying terms for participant and word. These will take care to let the model know of the structure of the data mentioned above. If you have other predictors in the model, you should also add them as (varying) slopes in the varying terms. For example: (question | participant) + (question | word) (where question = statement vs question).\nHere are some tutorials: Winter (2013), DeBruine and Barr (2021), Kirby and Sonderegger (2018), Bürkner (2018), Veenman, Stefan, and Haaf (2023), Pedersen et al.
