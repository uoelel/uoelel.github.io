### Definition

> A statement is falsifiable if it can be contradicted by an observation.
If such observation is impossible to make with current technology, falsifiability is not achieved.

From [Seven examples of falsifiability](https://simplicable.com/new/falsifiability) by John Spacey.

### Falsifiable statements

- "Life only exists on Earth." (it would be falsified by the observation of life somewhere else).
- "If there is a 1st person exclusive dual, then there is also a 1st person inclusive dual." [[Universal 1871]](https://typo.uni-konstanz.de/rara/universals-archive/1876/) (it would be falsified by the observation of languages with a 1st person exclusive dual but without the incluve alternative).
- "Infants start uttering full sentences only after their 12th month of life." (it would be falsified by the observation of infants uttering full sentences before their 12th month of life).

### Non-falsifiable statements

- "Life might exist outside of the Solar system." (if we observe life outside the Solar system or we don't, the statement is still true).
- "Languages with a 1st person inclusive dual can have a 1st person exclusive dual." (whether we observe a language with both 1st inclusive and exclusive dual or not, the statement is still true.)
