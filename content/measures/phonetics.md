### Acoustics

[Using Praat for linguistic research](https://github.com/stylerw/usingpraat) is an excellent starting point for learning which measurements and metrics can be used for which purposes and how to obtain them in Praat.

Common measurements are: Voice Onset Time, f0, pulses, jitter, shimmer, Harmonics-To-Noise ratio, formant frequency and bandwidth, intensity, harmonic amplitude, spectral tilt, centre of gravity, ...

### Articulatory data
