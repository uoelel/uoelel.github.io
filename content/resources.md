There are several resources you can use to teach yourself data analysis and statistic skills, depending on your level.

## Beginners

The following resources are suitable for beginners who want to learn data analysis and statistics from scratch.

### Statistics for Linguists

[Statistics for Linguists: An introduction using R](https://discovered.ed.ac.uk/permalink/44UOE_INST/7g3mt6/alma9924344853202466) by Bodo Winter is ideal both for absolute beginners and experienced researchers.

It is packed with everything you need to succesfully and effectively conduct statistical analyses.

### R for Data Science

The [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz) (R4DS) free online book is an excellent introduction to R and data analysis.

### The Data Visualisation Catalogue

The [Data Visualisation Catalogue](https://datavizcatalogue.com/index.html) is a project developed by Severino Ribecca to create a (non-code-based) library of different information visualisation types.
The website serves as a learning and inspiration resource for those working with data visualisation.

### Statistical (Re)thinking

[Statistical (Re)thinking](https://discovered.ed.ac.uk/permalink/44UOE_INST/110jsec/alma9924362502302466) by Richard McElreath is an excellent introduction for absolute beginners, by Richard McElreath, which covers a wide variety of linear models.
It focusses on Bayesian inference and how this framework can help us directly answer research questions, assess evidence for different hypothesis, and quantify uncertainty.

The code from the book has been translated into the tidyverse by Solomon Kurz, and it can be accessed here: [Statistical rethinking with brms, ggplot2, and the tidyverse](https://bookdown.org/content/4857/).

### intRo: Data Analysis with R

The workshop [intRo: Data Analysis with R](https://intro-rstats.github.io) introduces absolute beginners from the Humanities to R, data analysis and visualisation.



## Intermediate

If you have a basic understanding of data analysis, statistics, and R, these resources can help you develop your skills further.

### Generalised Additive (Mixed) Models

The tutorial [Generalised additive mixed models for dynamic analysis in linguistics: a practical introduction](https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/113858/2/1703_05339v1.pdf) by Márton Sóskuthy is an excellent introduction to Generalised Additive Mixed Models (GAMMs).
GAMMs are particularly useful with time series data and geographic coordinates.

Another excellent resource is [Hierarchical generalized additive models in ecology: an introduction with mgcv](https://peerj.com/articles/6876/) by Pedersen and colleagues.
In particular, [Figure 4](https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.6876/fig-4) is a beatiful visual summary of how different types of trends and groupings can be modelled with GAMs.

### Functional Data Analysis for Speech Research

[Functional Data Analysis for Speech Research](http://lands.let.ru.nl/FDA/index.htm) by Michele Gubian is a collection of resources, workshop materials and papers on Functional Data Analysis and Functional PCA focussed on speech research data.

### learnB4SS: Learn Bayesian Analysis for the Speech Sciences

The [learnB4SS](https://learnb4ss.github.io) workshop is an introduction to Bayesian analysis for Speech the Sciences.
It requires familiarity with linear models and Null Hypothesis Significance Testing.



## Advanced

### Multivariate linear models

[Estimating Multivariate Models with brms](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/brms/vignettes/brms_multivariate.html) by Paul Bürkner explains how to fit linear models with two or more outcome variables (i.e. multivariate models) using [brms](https://paul-buerkner.github.io/brms/).
