## Research questions and hypotheses

The online course [Constructing a hypothesis](https://uoepsy.github.io/prs/Question_01_constructing.html), from the PPLS [Practical Research Skills](https://uoepsy.github.io/prs/index.html) website, teaches you "how to operationalise your research question into an informative and falsifiable hypothesis".

## Experimental designs

Mits Ota has created a slide deck on how to plan a study for your research project. You can find the slides [here](docs/W2_preparing_projects.pdf).
