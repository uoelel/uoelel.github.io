Make sure you plan ahead and think about the analysis of your data as early as possible during the project.
**The best time to do so is when you are planning your study/project**. Do not wait until after you started collecting data.

We have compiled a check list for you and your supervisor to go over at the beginning of your supervision, while thinking about the project you will carry out.

It is important that you are able to answer all of these questions if you wish to make the most out of the statistical support we offer and more importantly **if you want to avoid irreparable issues later on**.

## The checklist

1. **Can you clearly state, in simple language, what the research question(s) of your project is/are?**
1. **If you are testing a specific hypothesis, did you formulate it so that it is a [falsifiable statement](https://simplicable.com/new/falsifiability)?**
    - Good examples:
        - "Life only exists on Earth." (it would be falsified by the observation of life somewhere else).
        - "If there is a 1st person exclusive dual, then there is also a 1st person inclusive dual." [[Universal 1871]](https://typo.uni-konstanz.de/rara/universals-archive/1876/) (it would be falsified by the observation of languages with a 1st person exclusive dual but without the incluve alternative).
        - "Infants start uttering full sentences only after their 12th month of life." (it would be falsified by the observation of infants uttering full sentences before their 12th month of life).
    - Bad examples:
        - "Life might exist outside of the Solar system." (if we observe life outside the Solar system or we don't, the statement is still true).
        - "Languages with a 1st person inclusive dual can have a 1st person exclusive dual." (whether we observe a language with both 1st inclusive and exclusive dual or not, the statement is still true.)
1. **Have you clearly defined the concepts/objects of study in your research question and hypothesis?**
1. **Have you operationalised the concepts/objects of study into clearly measurable variables?**
