Make sure you plan ahead and think about the analysis of your data as early as possible during the project.
**The best time to do so is when you are planning your study/project**. Do not wait until after you started collecting data.

We have compiled a check list for you and your supervisor to go over at the beginning of your supervision, while thinking about the project you will carry out.

It is important that you are able to answer all of these questions if you wish to make the most out of the statistical support we offer and more importantly **if you want to avoid irreparable issues later on**.

## The checklist

1. **Can you clearly state, in simple language, what the research question(s) of your project is/are?**
1. **If you are testing a specific hypothesis, did you formulate it so that it is a [falsifiable statement](falsifiable/)?**
1. **Have you clearly defined the concepts/objects of study in your research question and hypothesis?**
1. **Have you operationalised the concepts/objects of study into clearly measurable variables?**
1. **Which are your outcome variable(s) and your predictor variable(s)?**
1. **Your outcome variable(s) is of [which type](variable-types/)?**
1. **Which statistical model or test will you use to answer your research question or test your research hypothesis?**
1. **What is the justification for the chosen minimal sample size?**
