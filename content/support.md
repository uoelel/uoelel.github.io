We have different support channels for students who are writing their dissertation, PhD students, and researchers/staff.

### Undergraduate/Honours and Postgraduate Taught students

If you are a student writing your Honours and MSc dissertation, you can book a 1:1 appointment through the PPLS Skills Centre.

You will have to fill in a mandatory form when booking. It is very detailed and you won't be able to book if you don't fill it in. We recommend you to have a look at the form when you start planning your dissertation, even if you are not yet expecting to need a 1:1 appointment.

### PhD students

PhD students can get in contact with the LEL Senior Teaching Coordinator for Statistics, Dr Stefano Coretta, to book an appointment.

Most issues arising during data analyisis can be prevented by carefully planning your analysis ahead of data collection. We <b>strongly</b> recommend you to work out your data analysis plan while designing your research and <b>before</b> data collection begins.

### Researchers and other staff

Please, get in contact with Dr. Stefano Coretta to book an appointment.
