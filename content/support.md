If you are a student writing your Honours or MSc dissertation, you can book a **1:1 appointment** through the PPLS Skills Centre.

<u>**Before booking an appointment**</u> make sure you have agreed upon the details of your research design and the analysis plan with your supervisor.
When making the booking, you will have to fill a form with these details.

### Consultation for PhD students, postdocs and staff

Many of the issues arising during the data analyisis stage can be prevented by planning your analysis while designing the study and ahead of data collection.
<u>**We strongly recommend you to work out your data analysis plan in details as early as possible.**</u>
This expedient will save you time later on.

PhD students, postdoc researchers and staff can get in touch with the LEL Senior Teaching Coordinator for Statistics, Dr Stefano Coretta, to book an appointment.

Help is offered for the following areas:

* Study design and operationalisation of research hypothesis.
* Data wrangling and visualisation.
* Statistical modelling.
* Research data management (including Data Management Plans).
* Reporting.
* Open Science practices.


### Statistical service for staff

Postdocs and staff seeking for a collaborator to be tasked with planning and execution of statistical analyses, including reporting, can get in contact with Dr Stefano Coretta.
