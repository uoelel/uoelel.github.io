There are different support channels for Hons/MSc/PhD students who are writing their dissertation, and researchers/staff who are seeking help with any aspect of quantitative data analysis.

### General support

As a general guideline aimed at students, supervisors, and staff, we have compiled a checklist that covers all the main aspects of quantitative analyses.

You can use the checklist as a template to think about your quantitative analysis plan at the early stages of your dissertation/research project.

### Honours and MSc students

If you are a student writing your Honours or MSc dissertation and you are looking after help with your quantitative data analysis/statistics, you can book an appointment with Stefano, the LEL Stats coordinator (a university account is required).

### Consultation for PhD students, postdocs and staff

Many of the issues arising during the data analysis stage can be prevented by planning your analysis while designing the study and ahead of data collection.
<u>**We strongly recommend you to work out your quantitative data analysis plan in details as early as possible.**</u>
This expedient will save you time later on.

PhD students, postdoc researchers and staff can get in touch with the LEL Senior Teaching Coordinator for Statistics, Dr Stefano Coretta, or directly book an appointment via the link below (a university account is required).
