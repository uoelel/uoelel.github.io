We have different support channels for students who are writing their dissertation, PhD students, and researchers/staff who are seeking help with any aspect of quantitative data analysis.

### Undergraduate and Postgraduate students

If you are a student writing your Honours or MSc dissertation and you are looking after help with your quantitative data analysis/statistics, you can book a **1:1 appointment** through the PPLS Skills Centre (login required).

<u>**Before booking an appointment**</u> make sure you have agreed with your supervisor on the details of your research design and the quantitative analysis plan by going through [this checklist](analysis-checklist/).

### Consultation for PhD students, postdocs and staff

Many of the issues arising during the data analysis stage can be prevented by planning your analysis while designing the study and ahead of data collection.
<u>**We strongly recommend you to work out your data analysis plan in details as early as possible.**</u>
This expedient will save you time later on.

PhD students, postdoc researchers and staff can get in touch with the LEL Senior Teaching Coordinator for Statistics, Dr Stefano Coretta, to book an appointment.

Help is offered for the following areas:

* Study design and operationalisation of research hypothesis.
* Data wrangling and visualisation.
* Statistical modelling.
* Research data management (including Data Management Plans).
* Reporting.
* Open Science practices.


### Statistical service for staff

Dr Stefano Coretta is available as collaborator on projects or papers requiring the planning and execution of statistical analyses.

Interested postdocs or staff should contact Stefano for enquiries.
