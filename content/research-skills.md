## Plan

### Research questions and hypotheses

The online course [Constructing a hypothesis](https://uoepsy.github.io/prs/Question_01_constructing.html), from the PPLS [Practical Research Skills](https://uoepsy.github.io/prs/index.html) website, teaches you "how to operationalise your research question into an informative and falsifiable hypothesis".

### Research design

Mits Ota has created a slide deck on how to plan a study for your research project. You can find the slides [here](docs/W2_preparing_projects.pdf).

## Manage

### Best practices

[Best practices](https://help.osf.io/hc/en-us/categories/360001530634-Best-Practices) for researchers compiled by the Open Science Foundation. From file management to publishing research output.

### Open Science

[Seven Easy Steps to Open Science: An Annotated Reading List](https://doi.org/10.1027/2151-2604/a000387) will provide you with a great overview of Open Science and how to implement Open Science practices in your own research.

The first thing you can do to make your research open is to share the data and analysis code in public repositories, like the [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io).

### Version control with git

[Learn Version Control with Git](https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/ebook) is a gentle introduction to version control using the software git.
With git you can easily keep "snapshots" of your code, papers or dissertation, and track the full history of changes so that you can easily roll back to a previous state if necessary.

## Write

### Dynamic documents with Quarto and Rmarkdown

Write dynamic documents, from papers to dissertations, with [Quarto](https://quarto.org) or [Rmarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/docs/).

**Dynamic documents** are documents that mix plain text and code, so that you can embed your analyses straight into the document.

Code output like model summaries and plots are directly rendered within the document, and you don't have to include them manually.
The benefit is that if your data or analysis has changed, you can simply render the document again and everything will be up-to-date!

<div class="alert alert-warning">
  <strong>Quarto or Rmarkdown?</strong> Quarto is the <a href="https://quarto.org/docs/faq/rmarkdown.html">official successor of Rmarkdown</a> and it is heavily based on Rmarkdown. In fact, Quarto is 100% backward compatible with Rmarkdown. Rmarkdown will not go away!

### Write with LaTeX

[Learn LaTeX in 30 minutes](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Learn_LaTeX_in_30_minutes) and focus on writing content rather than formatting it.

You should also check out the [Practical Research Skills](https://uoepsy.github.io/prs/index.html) website.
Although it focusses on psychological research, most of the methods and concepts also apply to linguistic research.
