### Research study planning

Mits Ota has created a slide deck on how to plan a study for your research project. You can find the slides [here](docs/W2_preparing_projects.pdf).

### Research best practices

[Best practices](https://help.osf.io/hc/en-us/categories/360001530634-Best-Practices) for researchers compiled by the Open Science Foundation. From file management to publishing research output.

### Open Science

[Seven Easy Steps to Open Science: An Annotated Reading List](https://doi.org/10.1027/2151-2604/a000387) will provide you with a great overview of Open Science and how to implement Open Science practices in your own research.

The first thing you can do to make your research open is to share the data and analysis code in public repositories, like the [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io).

### Dynamic documents in Rmarkdown

Write dynamic documents, from papers to dissertations, with Rmarkdown.
More information [here](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/docs/).

### Write with LaTeX

[Learn LaTeX in 30 minutes](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Learn_LaTeX_in_30_minutes) and focus on writing content rather than formatting it.

### Version control with git

[Learn Version Control with Git](https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/ebook) is a gentle introduction to version control using the software git.
With git you can easily keep "snapshots" of your code, papers or dissertation, and track the full history of changes so that you can easily roll back to a previous state if necessary.
